This document contains a list of resources that cover whether and how to use asynchronous messaging/queueing and eventing infrastructures 
with your applications effectively and which you can use for self-study purposes. 

My name is Clemens Vasters and I am the product architect of the messaging and eventing services in the Microsoft Azure cloud and have helped 
building these capabilities for over 15 years now, starting well before the name "Azure" even existed. Our team owns multiple hyperscale broker 
platforms (Azure Service Bus, Event Hubs, Event Grid, and Relay) that are deployed in hundreds of large clusters in over 60 Azure regions 
all around the world and handle many (!) trillion (!) requests each day (!). We also invented, prototyped, and productized several other 
Azure capabilities (Azure IoT Hub, Azure Notification Hubs, Tenant Resource Provisioning) that are now owned by different teams at Microsoft. 
All those services are also listed below and I will also link to the corresponding services from AWS and GCP. 

In addition to the product work, I am deeply engaged in open interoperability standards and represent Microsoft on the OASIS AMQP Technical 
Commitee (as co-chair), the OASIS MQTT Technical Committee, the CNCF Open Telemetry Working Group, the CNCF CloudEvents project, and the 
CNCF Serverless Working Group. In the past, I've also been a member of the OPC Foundations Technical Advisory Council and the OPC UA Working 
Group where I've worked on the PubSub specification in particular. Relevant technical documents are also linked below.
